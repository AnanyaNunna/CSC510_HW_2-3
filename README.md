# Software Engineering Homework 2 & 3

## Experimentation setup 

Helo from VIjay

NOTE: *Below is just an idea of how we can go about - any changes is appreciated lol *
- Use repl to run the desired script. Repl supports `Python, Ruby and Golang`
- (How are we testing?)
  - Introduce bugs and ask them to debug 
  - Give the entire script and just see if they can understand it 
- Have a Google form to have a survey to see which language they found most easy to understand [Come up with common questions]
- We as the people conducting experiements need to agree on "tags/categories" to put the behavior of our subjects into and have separate google sheet to write this out as well.
