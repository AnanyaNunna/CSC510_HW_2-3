# Software Engineering Homework 2 & 3

## Experimentation setup 

NOTE: **Below is just an idea of how we can go about - any suggestions are appreciated**
- Use repl to run the desired script. Repl supports `Python, Ruby and Golang`
- How are we testing?
  - Introduce bugs in the code
  - Get information from volunteers about their experitise in the available languages (survey)
  - Ask for volunteers who are unfamiliar with the language to debug the code
  - Provide the volunteers with Unit test codes to verify successfull debugging
  - Actively monitor the volunteers for time taken to debug each bug and classify the ease of debugging syntactical and logical errors in different languages
- Have a post survey with each volunteer about the test experience.
- We as the people conducting experiements need to agree on "tags/categories" to put the behavior of our subjects into and have separate google sheet to write this out as well.
